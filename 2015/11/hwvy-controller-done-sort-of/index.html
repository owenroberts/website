		<p>Finally got something working for the non-butt version of my HWYV sequencer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmUU6m2OfDs" target="_blank">this is the butt version</a>). Â There were several bad design ideas before I decided to 3d print it. Â It took 3 prints but I got something close enough to hold the circuit and strong enough to work with the force sensing resistor. Â A unintended benefit of the 3d print is that the platform is a little flexible so its actually a more responsive surface than earlier wood prototypes.</p>

<p><img  src="/assets/img_0298-e1448001486108.jpg" alt="IMG_0298" /></a></p>
<p>I used the same leather and sewing technique to hold the FSRs as in a previous analog synth. Â It took almost four hours to sew the leather patches into place and I felt like it was a pretty stupid approach while I was doing it, but now that I'm done I think it's really nice, and if I actually use it a lot and perform some HWYV stuff I guess 4 hours isn't much.</p>

<p><img 1970" src="/assets/img_0300-e1448001749760.jpg" alt="IMG_0300" /></a></p>
<p>The controller has two FSRs, the two black leather patches, one controls the rate at which the sampler plays a sample, the second controlsÂ the start time of that sample. Â The slider at the top (which needs a slider knob) controls the duration of the sample. Â The blue buttons move between different channels. Â Currently the sequencer uses 8 channels (each channel plays a different sample). Â The red button records the performance of the sequencer on each channel so it can be played back. Â The two green buttons I added as auxiliary buttons in case I come up with future functionality. Â A couple ideas I have are a mute button for each channel (thought that's sort of counter-intuitive the musical approach behind HWYV), a on/off toggle for adjusting the sample length (currently it switches only when the slider changes, but the slider potentiometer is a little noisy, so it changes more than I would like it) and another is something to toggle between different sets of music. Â Since I have to use a computer anyway, I usually do this just by triggering them in with the mouse, but would be nice do not have to do that.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img_0310-e1448002114889.jpg" alt="IMG_0310"  /></a></p>
<p>I also updated the code in two significant ways. Â First off, I realized that the logic in the original version was totally out to lunch. Â I had two simultaneous systems, one a bunch of booleans, the other a series of state changes, to keep track of which channels had recorded performances and which didn't, and how to play them back. Â I realized that I could get rid of about 75% of the bogus logic I had written in 2012 by using only the state changes. Â It's kind of interesting to see how bad my approach was back then. Â The original program didn't use classes at all, instead I just had a bunch of different array keeping track of recordings on each channel. Â So I made a Channel class which made everything much simpler.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/screen-shot-2015-11-20-at-2-56-31-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-20 at 2.56.31 PM"  /></a></p>
<p>I also completely redesigned the visual interface. Â I still need to rethink how I'm representing tempo, sample time and sample beginning positions, right now it is a little counter intuitive though easy for me because I understand what the numbers represent. Â The biggest change was the color scheme, which was just white, black and red, to something a little more friendly on the eyes. Â But I'm not sure the horizontal organization makes sense, it looks more like a mixing board, which is fine, but the bars look more like expressions of volume (which in a way they are, but not literally) than tempo, so I may return to a horizontal look. Â Overall, a huge step forward but still a lot of improvements to be made.</p>
<p>What I really need to do now is start making some recordings and putting them on Soundcloud or something. Â I'm a little worried about copyright violations but the tracks are so distorted it seems somewhat unlikely.</p>
