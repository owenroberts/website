My friend said that I shouldn't fuck with guys like her boyfriend because he might actually kill me and that he <button onclick="location.href='probably.html'">probably</button> had a gun and stuff.  I laughed but then I wondered if it was true and then my parents like getting the <button onclick="location.href='news.html'">news</button> that I had been killed by some guy because I was friend with his girlfriend.  And there would be a trial, and my dad would be like, Did they even have sexual intercourse?  And she'd say <i>No</i> and everyone would be like, What the fuck are we even doing here?
