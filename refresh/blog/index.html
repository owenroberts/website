She had this blog I had forgotten about.  She called me to ask me to fix it.  The server was down.

I thought <button onclick='location.href="bf.html"'>Shouldn't your boyfriend fix your blog?</button>  But I fixed it and then read everything on it.  It took a few hours.  I thought about myself pretty much every time I read it and had a feeling in my stomach usually or a burning in my brain.  I thought she was writing to me.  But when she talked about his hair I knew it wasn't me and that <button onclick='location.href="felt.html"'>felt</button> worse.
