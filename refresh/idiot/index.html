When they broke up he killed the pig.  Well, she didn't really know how to deal with it in her own apartment.  He took it back and then he turned it into bacon or <button onclick='location.href="whatever.html"'>whatever</button>.  I feel like pigs would get too old to become meat.  Who knows?  She wrote about it on her blog and I wondered if he ever read it, like would he see that she had written about it, but I didn't ask.
