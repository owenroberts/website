Version one<br><br>
It was <button onclick="location.href='funny.html'">funny</button> to think about someone I didn't know hating me.  But what exactly the joke was really depends again on the timing, May vs. September. Well, regardless, the ending is that I was chased for a while, stopped running, tried to punch a guy twice my size in the face and then got choked half to <button onclick="location.href='death.html'">death</button> before he started crying and I pushed him off of me. I remember asking if he was okay and then running away when he looked at me.  Then I didn't know where I was, I called her but I couldn't stop laughing. She did not think it was funny.
