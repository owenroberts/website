I can't remember exactly what the blog post said but I have this feeling it described exactly why we were getting a drinka and why he found us there.  Something about the way she was describing me, I finally realized I was a distraction from him.  She compared me to the <button onclick='location.href="metaphor.html"'>pig</button> I guess because we were both good to her but we were just a pig or something.  It was the way we looked at her, maybe.
