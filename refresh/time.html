Version two<br><br>
The evidence in  emails and chats from Google say it happened in May.  She was still with him and I still thought she wanted to be with me.  In the emails we sound like teenagers.  Nothing had happened.  His suspicions would have been justified, but not accurate, like when he wrote me, <button onclick='location.href="because.html"'>"Your cock will never live up to mine"</button>, and <button onclick='location.href="disrespect.html"'>"What you are doing is very disrespectul, you shit eating weiner fuck ass"</button>.  In my version, all of that had already happened and it was more like payback and less like a peremptory attack.
