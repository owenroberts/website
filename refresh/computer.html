I keep trying to remember where I was and what I was feeling when I typed all of my <button onclick='location.href="memory.html"'>memories</button> into my laptop or some other machine.  The computer doesn't record that part, you can't really recreate nausea or light headedness.  I know I felt <button onclick='location.href="something.html"'>something</button>, probably something weird.  It says that I asked her to get a drink in May.  But I really <i>feel</i> like it was September.  I probably wouldn't have gotten attacked in September I guess.
