The first time we met it was on my friends roof and we were making jokes about HTML5.  We were very drunk and she stayed up late with me.  We made plans to get coffee the next day.  And then we didn't and a few weeks later she finally called me back and eventually I realized that the boyfriend was why we never had coffee that time.  But not from her blog or anything.  It was just sort of <button onclick='location.href="obvious.html"'>obvious</button>.
