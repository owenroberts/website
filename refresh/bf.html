Her <button onclick='location.href="server.html"'>server</button> settings hadn't been updated in three years.  I just had to click some buttons and watch some progress bars.  It took fifteen minutes.  I was reading this sex blog by some guy my friend apparently knew because she sent it to me and thinking about writing a <button onclick='location.href="fake.html"'>fake</button> sex blog.  But I didn't feel like I knew enough words to describe sex to have my own sex blog, especially a fake one.
