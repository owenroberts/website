I never saw him again after that but I was always a little scared that I would. He lived on my street, half a mile south. Sometimes I would see someone sitting in the window of a bar or a coffee shop with his face structure and feel that nervous burning in my stomach. After a couple of <button onclick='location.href="months.html"'>months</button> I was less scared to walk through my neighborhood. But then I'd see another doppelg√§nger and become a little scaredy pants again.
