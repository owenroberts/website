She deleted her old <button onclick='location.href="blog.html"'>blog</button>.  I had to ask her if she remembered the post about her ex-boyfriend and me.  Maybe she had a copy.  She said she never wrote a post like that.  I looked forever through emails thinking I might be remembering an email, clicking the little "older" arrow.
