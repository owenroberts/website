She asked me questions constantly.  They ranged from weird, like <button onclick='location.href="love.html"'>Could you fall in love with someone who had been a murderer?</button> to not so weird, or weirdly mundane, like <button onclick='location.href="pencil.html"'>Do you write with a pen or a pencil?</button> and shit like that.  I always laughed and she got offended because it was important and I couldn't deal.  We were like two little halves of a peach, her with the pit, me with a void.
