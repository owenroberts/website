It happened one of two ways.  In my version I've already been rejected by her and we've already slept together and the whole thing is kind of absurd.  But I really remember it that way.  I remember that feeling.  But if it happened when the computer, when the emails and chats that are stored on the a server somewhere that I look at on my computer, say it happened, then I was still trying to get with her and he was still with her.  Which makes more sense but also makes me seem like more of a dick I think.  Who is right?
