Of course I looked around for those old blogs but there was no record so either I'm now crazy or she deleted them.  I thought about leaving something like a joke for her to find, like a txt file with a <button onclick='location.href="memory.html"'>stupid</button> fake love letter about how I was still obsessed with her, but I thought enough about the joke and realized I definitely couldn't pull it off because she probably wouldn't laugh even if it was called "poop.txt" and she would probably never find it.
