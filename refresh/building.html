A lot of it didn't seem real, but I think it was real and the language was just borrowed from something vaguely familiar.  The buildings in particular were very important and over described.  The kind of building that exist in dreams, with a <button onclick='location.href="alone.html"'>roof</button> or a <button onclick='location.href="alone.html"'>window</button> and nothing else.
