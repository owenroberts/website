I met him once by accident and then she was sure it never happened again though it might have been on purpose, unconsciously, or maybe she was conflicted about it <button onclick='location.href="or.html"'>or something</button>.  He said I seemed like an asshole.  She told me later.  She said maybe it would be better if she didn't tell me these things and I said maybe so and she stopped.  We didn't talk for a long time, so that particular night, the second time I ever saw him, I didn't know anything about the <button onclick='location.href="emails.html"'>emails</button> he had read, the blog posts she had written, any of it, and I guess that was what she might have told me about except I told her not to.
