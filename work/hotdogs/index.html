<p>Hotdogs is part of a series in progress that I began developing as part of <a href="https://critcrit.club/" target="blank">Crit</a> in Fall 2017.  "Hotdogs Part 1" was shown with other members of Crit at <a href="https://www.ghostnewyork.info/ghost-schedule/2018/1/17/two" target="blank">Ghost Gallery</a> in Brooklyn.  It was a really fun show.  Crit is awesome, I recommend anyone to apply.  Since the project was just a website, I made a little poster and installed that in the gallery.</p>
<p>Part 1 is available at the URL <a href="http://hotdogs.cool/" target="blank">hotdogs.cool</a>.  It requires a mobile phone with a browser to view and headphones are very recommended.</p>
<p>I'm still working on Parts 2 & 3, I hope to release them during 2018, like, soon ish.</p>
<p>Update: Part 2, Trampoline, is available now at <a href="https://trampoline.cool" target="blank">trampoline.cool</a>.</p>

<p>Another update: I made a WebVR version using the SteroEffect code from an old Google Cardboard example, it's up at <a href="https://vr.hotdogs.cool" target="blank">vr.hotdogs.cool</a>.  I have to say, the VR experience is definitely worse than the original pseudo-VR version.  The new WebVR stuff didn't work for what I built in three.js so this is a little cobbled together.  I wanted to give this a try as a way to have some new VR project to potentially submit to stuff but I don't really like VR.  Anyway, it's up and you can try it out if you have a Cardboard or Daydream or some other smart phone VR viewer.</p>

<p>The 2D animation in Hotdogs uses an animation tool called <a href="https://github.com/owenroberts/lines" target="blank">lines</a> that I've been developing for a few years.</p>
