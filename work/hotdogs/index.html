<p>Hot Dogs is a series of mobile web based interactive 3D animations I began developing as part of <a href="https://critcrit.club/" target="blank">Crit</a> in Fall 2017.  "Hot Dogs Part 1" was shown with other members of Crit at <a href="https://www.ghostnewyork.info/exhibitions/2018/1/17/two" target="blank">Ghost Gallery</a> in Brooklyn.  It was a really fun show.  Crit is awesome, I recommend anyone to apply.  Since the project was just a website, I made a little poster and installed that in the gallery.</p>

<p>Part 1 is available at the URL <a href="http://hotdogs.cool/" target="blank">hotdogs.cool</a>.  It requires a mobile phone with a browser to view and headphones are very recommended.</p>

<p>Part 2, Trampoline, is available  at <a href="https://trampoline.cool" target="blank">trampoline.cool</a>.</p>

<p>Part 3, Funeral, is available  at <a href="https://funeral.cool" target="blank">funeral.cool</a>.</p>

<p>I made a WebVR version using the SteroEffect code from an old Google Cardboard example, it's up at <a href="https://vr.hotdogs.cool" target="blank">vr.hotdogs.cool</a>. The VR experience is definitely worse than the original.  The new WebVR stuff didn't work for what I built in three.js so this is a little cobbled together.  Anyway, it's up and you can try it out if you have a Cardboard or Daydream or some other smart phone VR viewer.</p>

<p>The 2D animation in Hotdogs uses an animation tool called <a href="https://github.com/owenroberts/lines" target="blank">lines</a> that I've been developing for a few years.</p>
