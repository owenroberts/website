<p>Endlessness is an existential take on the endless runner genre. Collect televisions, coffee pots and toilets as you walk across a procedurally generated landscape of graveyards, ghosts and computer generated poems. Choose from six characters to control as they search for meaning by collecting letters from an alien alphabet.</p>
