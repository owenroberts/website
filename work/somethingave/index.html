	<p>Something Ave. is an art app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/something-ave./id927062106?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps?id=com.owenribbit.somethingave" target="_blank">Android</a>. &nbsp;The app tells the story through a hand drawn mobile phone interface. &nbsp;It originated as a <a href="https://mobydonut.wordpress.com/2014/12/09/something-ave-released-today/" target="blank">pretty simple joke</a> I thought of while walking around Long Island City in the summer of 2013 but developed into a big project that ended up taking about a year to complete and had a release party at the Gitana Rosa Gallery in January 2015, for which I also created the installation The Dead Shall Be Raised. &nbsp;I began working on Something Ave. under the title Lostly at the <a href="http://mobydonut.wordpress.com/cac-recap/" target="blank">CAC residency</a> in Troy, New York. &nbsp;The story&nbsp;is about the former owner of the phone, Blue, whose information the viewer is voyeuristically exploring, who slowly loses touch with reality. &nbsp;The versions of the conventional smart phone apps, like Messages, Phone, Maps, Notes, Camera, Photos and Calendar, are rendered in watercolors and pen and ink drawings, reflecting their representation not of reality, but of Blueâ€™s perspective on the world, which is deteriorating as he finds it difficult to connect with a past friend despite the immediacy of their communication through the device.</p>

	<p>At the opening at Gitana Rosa I exhibited some of the original drawings that I made to create the app (and some that got censored by Apple):</p>

	<p>The opening also featured the installation <a title="The Dead Shall Be Raised" href="/work/thedeadshallberaised/">The Dead Shall Be Raised</a>, which is based on the app.</p>
