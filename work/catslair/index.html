<p>catslair is a networked, interactive, mobile web based animation which I developed the <a href="http://catwalkartresidency.com/" target="_blank">Catwalk Artist Residency</a> in January 2019.  Here are <a href="http://lines.owen.cool/catskill/2019/01/20/catwalk-1.html" target="_blank">some drawings</a> I did while I was in Catskill.</p>

<p>You can view catslair at <a href="http://catslair.owen.cool" target="_blank">catslair.owen.cool</a>.  It's multiplayer and relies on audio so you may want to view it with some friends nearby also viewing it on their own phones :/</p>
