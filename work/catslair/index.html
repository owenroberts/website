<p>catslair is a networked, interactive, mobile web based animation which I developed the Catwalk Artist Residency in January 2019.</p>

<p>You can view catslair at <a href="http://catslair.owen.cool" target="_blank">catslair.owen.cool</a>.  It's multiplayer and relies on audio so you may want to view it with some friends nearby also viewing it on their own phones :/</p>
