	<p>For the <a href="http://recessionartshows.com/exhibitions/current/" target="blank">Recession Art Print Exchange</a>, I proposed doing a mixed media print, based on a character in a larger interactive work that I have been developing. The print consists of a screen print, scanned and used as the texture for a 3D character, then digitally printed with the screen print then printed on top. Read more about the process on <a href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/blog/category/printmaking-exchange/">my blog</a>.</p>
