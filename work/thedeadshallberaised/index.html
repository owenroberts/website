	<p>The Dead Shall Be Raised is an installation created in the Gitana Rosa Gallery for the release of my art app <a title="Something Ave." href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/something-ave/">Something Ave.</a>&nbsp; It recreates a scene related to the app, a cemetery in the fictional world of Something Ave. with the tombstones of the characters from the app. &nbsp;I created it in the space over a couple of weeks leading to the opening, which features drawings from the app. &nbsp;There are about 120 water color paintings that make up the tiles on the walls and ceiling, 12 cardboard panels painted with acrylic and gesso for the floor and 6 tombstones constructed out of cardboard and painted with gesso and acrylic.</p>
