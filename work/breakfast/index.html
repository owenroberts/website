<p>Based on the story line <a href="http://lines.owen.cool/birds/2018/01/29/birds1.html" target="blank">bird breakfast</a> from my comic <a href="http://lines.owen.cool/" target="blank">lines</a>, and the <a href="../birdbreakfast/">animated version</a>, <a href="http://breakfast.owen.cool" target="blank">breakfast.owen.cool</a> is a multiplayer, 3D, web based interactive environment.</p>

<p>This project is a both a work in progress and a proof of concept for a larger project I've been working on.  It combines the 3D animations I started working on with the hot dogs trilogy and the networked stuff I've been doing with some other projects.  It's multiplayer, so bring some friends along if you want to try it out.  However, if you don't have friends, the server will add some fake ones for you.</p>
