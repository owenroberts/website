<p><i>Clone Killer</i> is an interactive installation that collapses video game aesthetics with a science fiction short story about clones.  The user interacts with video and animation through shooting the screen with a hacked Nintendo Entertainment system gun.  This points to the absurdity of this interaction as a way to advance narrative, as it is used in arcade games.  The story involves a rivalry between a man and his clone.</p>
