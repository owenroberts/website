	<p>Getting To Know You is an art app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gtky-getting-to-know-you/id958436305?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owenribbit.gettingtoknowyou" target="_blank">Android</a> (also coming soon, Google Cardboard VR version for Android). &nbsp;The app tells a story through the exploration of obscure and moving landscapes. &nbsp;The camera in the virtual world is mapped to the rotation of your device, so users must move around to make there way through the world. &nbsp;I <a href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/banff-week-2/" target="blank">began developing</a> GTKY at the Banff Artist in Residence program in August of 2014.</p>

	<p>This is an installation of an early version of the app in the Philosopher’s Knoll at Banff. &nbsp;I projected the iPad onto a wall so that other viewer’s could watch as one person interacted with the app.</p>
