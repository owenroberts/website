	<p>Refresh is an art app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/refresh-by-owen-ribbit/id793575408?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owenribbit.refresh" target="_blank">Android</a>&nbsp;(in the app store its called Refresh by Owen Ribbit because Refresh has&nbsp;already taken by an unpublished app). &nbsp;This started as an Internet based project that was <a href="http://mobydonut.wordpress.com/refresh-app/" target="blank">in reaction</a> to some research I was doing on net art. &nbsp;It tells a story in a sort of maze, with buttons connecting pages in a narrative, while each page will time out at a certain point and Refresh the app back to the beginning, modeling video games that send the character to the beginning of a level each time they “die”. &nbsp;Through repeated readings of these pages the viewer pieces together the narrative and learns the various pathways from beginning to end.</p>
