<p>Trampoline is Part 2 in the <a href="/work/hotdogs/">Hot Dogs</a> trilogy.</p> 
<p>Trampoline is live at <a href="http://trampoline.cool">trampoline.cool</a>.  Mobile browser required.  Headphones recommended.</p>

<p>The text and three drawings from the piece were included in Menagerie, part of the <a href="https://www.duplexart.com/menagerie" target="blank">Menagerie show curated by Duplex</a>, including a reading on the night the zine was released, in March 2018.</p>

<p>In August 2018, Trampoline was part of the <a href="https://www.dusklit.com/artists/" target="blank">Dusklit</a> interactive art festival in Sugar Loaf NY.  Here are some install photos, evidence of why I do screen based work.</p>
