<p>I have met them at close of day<br />
Coming with vivid faces<br />
From counter or desk among grey<br />
Eighteenth-century houses.<br />
I have passed with a nod of the head<br />
Or polite meaningless words,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/retail.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126" title="retail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/retail.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>Or have lingered awhile and said<br />
Polite meaningless words,<br />
And thought before I had done<br />
Of a mocking tale or a gibe<br />
To please a companion<br />
Around the fire at the club,<br />
Being certain that they and I<br />
But lived where motley is worn:<br />
All changed, changed utterly:<br />
A terrible beauty is born.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hottie.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" title="hottie" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hottie.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>That woman’s days were spent<br />
In ignorant good-will,<br />
Her nights in argument<br />
Until her voice grew shrill.<br />
What voice more sweet than hers<br />
When, young and beautiful,<br />
She rode to harriers?<br />
This man had kept a school<br />
And rode our winged horse;<br />
This other his helper and friend<br />
Was coming into his force;<br />
He might have won fame in the end,<br />
So sensitive his nature seemed,<br />
So daring and sweet his thought.<br />
This other man I had dreamed<br />
A drunken, vainglorious lout.</p>

<p>He had done most bitter wrong<br />
To some who are near my heart,<br />
Yet I number him in the song;<br />
He, too, has resigned his part<br />
In the casual comedy;<br />
He, too, has been changed in his turn,<br />
Transformed utterly:<br />
A terrible beauty is born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hearts with one purpose alone<br />
Through summer and winter seem<br />
Enchanted to a stone<br />
To trouble the living stream.<br />
The horse that comes from the road.<br />
The rider, the birds that range<br />
From cloud to tumbling cloud,<br />
Minute by minute they change;<br />
A shadow of cloud on the stream<br />
Changes minute by minute;<br />
A horse-hoof slides on the brim,<br />
And a horse plashes within it;<br />
The long-legged moor-hens dive,<br />
And hens to moor-cocks call;<br />
Minute by minute they live:<br />
The stone’s in the midst of all.</p>
<p>Too long a sacrifice<br />
Can make a stone of the heart.<br />
O when may it suffice?<br />
That is Heaven’s part, our part<br />
To murmur name upon name,<br />
As a mother names her child<br />
When sleep at last has come<br />
On limbs that had run wild.<br />
What is it but nightfall?<br />
No, no, not night but death;<br />
Was it needless death after all?<br />
For England may keep faith<br />
For all that is done and said.<br />
We know their dream; enough<br />
To know they dreamed and are dead;<br />
And what if excess of love<br />
Bewildered them till they died?<br />
I write it out in a verse -<br />
MacDonagh and MacBride<br />
And Connolly and Pearse<br />
Now and in time to be,<br />
Wherever green is worn,<br />
Are changed, changed utterly:<br />
A terrible beauty is born.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125" title="pinkberry" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pinkberry.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="317" /></span></p>
