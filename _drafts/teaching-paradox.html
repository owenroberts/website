<p>Working full time in 2015-2016 has given me more time to prepare for class and reflect on my teaching methods.  Something I've noticed recently is the conflict of being prepared for class and grading homework.  Because I have to have something to do in class once or twice a week (this semester it breaks down to six times a week), preparing the class lecture, assignment and demonstration is always my most urgent task.  Because I'm focused on that task, grading the most recent homework assignment is often pushed back to I can finish the next lecture, which means that the lecture isn't based on what the students did for their last assignment.  This is a problem, because I will find after I've taught the class, when I begin grading the assignments from the week before, what the students did or didn't understand.  In an ideal world, I would grade all of the assignments, take diligent notes on what needs to be reviewed and what worked well, and then begin on the next week's lesson.  Because I'm always running out of time, this is almost never the case.  But, in theory, if I followed this schedule with more dedication, my lectures would be more effective, the homework would be better, and there would be less to review or go over again from week to week.  What usually happens is I grade two or three weeks worth of assignments in one long grading time and start to get a picture of how much material actually sunk in with my students.</p>
