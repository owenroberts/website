<p>Many ingenious lovely things are gone<br />
That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude,<br />
protected from the circle of the moon</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/24hr.jpg" /></p>
<p>That pitches common things about. There stood<br />
Amid the ornamental bronze and stone<br />
An ancient image made of olive wood -<br />
And gone are phidias' famous ivories<br />
And all the golden grasshoppers and bees.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pastel.jpg" /></p>
<p>We too had many pretty toys when young:<br />
A law indifferent to blame or praise,</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/traffic.jpg"  /><br />
To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong<br />
Melt down, as it were wax in the sun's rays;<br />
Public opinion ripening for so long<br />
We thought it would outlive all future days.<br />
O what fine thought we had because we thought<br />
That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vince.jpg"/></p>
<p>All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,<br />
And a great army but a showy thing;<br />
What matter that no cannon had been turned<br />
Into a ploughshare? Parliament and king<br />
Thought that unless a little powder burned<br />
The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting<br />
And yet it lack all glory; and perchance<br />
The guardsmen's drowsy chargers would not prance.</p>
<p>Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare<br />
Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery<br />
Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,<br />
To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;<br />
The night can sweat with terror as before<br />
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,<br />
And planned to bring the world under a rule,<br />
Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.</p>
<p>He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned<br />
Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant<br />
From shallow wits; who knows no work can stand,<br />
Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent<br />
On master-work of intellect or hand,<br />
No honour leave its mighty monument,<br />
Has but one comfort left: all triumph would<br />
But break upon his ghostly solitude.<br />
But is there any comfort to be found?</p>
<p>Man is in love and loves what vanishes,<br />
What more is there to say? That country round<br />
None dared admit, if Such a thought were his,<br />
Incendiary or bigot could be found<br />
To burn that stump on the Acropolis,<br />
Or break in bits the famous ivories<br />
Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.</p>
