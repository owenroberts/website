<p>Started working on my new app/fiction/animation project and added some features to the animation tool I started last semester:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2038" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2016-03-07-at-11-18-44-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-07 at 11.18.44 PM.png" width="1121" height="496" /></p>
<p>Including new colors, a frame preview window, and functions to "explode" and "follow" a drawing.  Here's a <a href="http://owenroberts.github.io/bc/animations/sky.html" target="_blank">little test</a> (this is all in HTML5 canvas, no rendered images).</p>
<p>Only problem I just realized is that this json file with the animation data is 19 mb.  Need to compress this little guy!</p>
