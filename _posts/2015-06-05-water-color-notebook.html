<p>I made a new notebook out of the leftover paper from the Something Ave. Messages paintings I did for the opening.  I had a bunch leftover so I made a 15 page 5 x 7 notebook with a stab bound cover using the board from some old mixed media notebooks.  Turned out okay, but realized the paper is way too thick to make a good stab bound book, probably going to be hard to actually use past page 3 or so, though I guess I could cut the pages out as I go.</p>
