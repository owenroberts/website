<p>I made a little zine last week, adapting the program I wrote for Ann and my "Fingers" piece to do single character substitutions instead of double.  The text ends up being pretty funny, and I illustrated it with some simple cat drawings.  Not really sure what I think about it but it was fun.</p>
