<p>Being a computer artist can be a drag.</p>

<p>Last night while working on a new project (which will soon be up at toilet.cool), I installed the new iOS version, 12.2, on my phone while I was taking a break.  When I sat back down, suddenly it wasn't working.</p>

<p>After doing some basic debugging I realized nothing had changed except the update, so I googled and turns out "Motion and Orientation" access on iOS had been disabled by default, for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/in-the-name-of-privacy-apple-plans-to-limit-ar-features-in-mobile-safari/" target="_blank">privacry</a> concerns.</p>

<p>This quickly sent me into a tail spin.  All of the major work I have done for the past year consists of websites that use "Motion and Orientation" on mobile phones to enable interactive 3D animations.  All of the projects that I had sent to various applications for grants, residencies, exhibitions, festivals, etc. would be broken on iPhones.</p>

<p>My panic subsided a bit when I realized that the update had basically just been released on March 25, so there was a decent chance that people accessing my sites over the past two weeks hadn't updated yet.  Still, there's a high probability that more than one person reviewing some application I wrote attempted to view my work and found a site that was telling them to open it in their mobile phone instead of desktop, even though they were on their mobile phone :/</p>
