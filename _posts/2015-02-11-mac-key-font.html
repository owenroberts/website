<p>I made a font that looks like the Mac keyboard to use for demo posts for my class blogs.  I had been wanting to use something like that for a while to give key commands for using Photoshop and other programs in my intro classes.  There were a few already existing, but I didn't like the aesthetic of any of them, I wanted something where key character or phrase was the negative space so I could change the color of the key rather than the character, like this:</p>

<p>I'm using it for my two BMCC classes this semester.  Here's the <a href="https://github.com/owenroberts/key-cmd-font" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> to get the font and CSS to implement it.</p>
