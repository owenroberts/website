<p>I made an art app/game thing over the last year called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1039689920&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Toenail Swim</a> which is now in the Apple Store.  It will run on iPhone or iPad, probably cooler on iPad, and remember to wear headphones.  The game is free, I wasn't as happy with this one, but wanted to finish it because I put a lot of work into it, but I don't want to charge a dollar or whatever for it.  Android version should be out soon.</p>
