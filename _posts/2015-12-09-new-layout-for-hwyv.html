<p>I redesigned the hwyv sequencer layout in a way that I think represents time and what's happening in the program more accurately, using horizontal channels instead of vertical. Â Recorded a screen shot of a bit of performance using samples from the John Cage work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt-_LghkxaE" target="_blank">Six Melodies</a> that I plan to eventually use as background music in my <a href="https://mobydonut.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/new-game/">new game</a>.</p>
