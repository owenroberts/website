<p>We have a Replicator 2 at the Tech Crafts office that hasn't really been used for a year. Â I've been designing and interface for my voice effects synth for the Booger Bus and other animations, but it's a bit tricky and isn't ready to print yet, so I printed a scene from the <a title="Getting To Know You" href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/getting-to-know-you/">GTKY</a> app to see how it would come out and just to get the MakerBot going.</p>
