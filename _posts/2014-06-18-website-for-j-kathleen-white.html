<p>I launched a site for the artist J. Kathleen White yesterday.  I've been working with Kathleen for almost a year now to create video, ebooks and this website.  It's been really fun to see and read her work.</p>

<p>Still need to debug a few things because it relies on a lot of SVGs, which aren't supported by older Android and Internet Explorer browsers, but its looking pretty good:</p>
