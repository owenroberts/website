<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/refresh-by-owen-ribbit/id793575408?mt=8">Apple published my app.</a></p>

<p>I was surprised at first.  I still feel slightly ambivalent about it.  I sent it to friends and published a screen shot on instagram.  I felt a little woozy as I saw likes appearing on the Instagram post.  But I think that's a good feeling, it means, I guess that some guts went into the story.  The story isn't really mine, it has some elements, but the attitude and the plots are mostly lifted from 4chan stories, livejournal stories and weird sex blogs that I read.  There's a reference to one such blog, which doesn't exist anymore, but I saved a cached version from Google a few years back so I would never lose it.  But there's nothing to indicate that context.  I don't know.  I hope people like it, but I have to be okay with people not liking it too.</p>
