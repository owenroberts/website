<p>I've been slowly working on a new app.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what it will be but I am starting to try to incorporate content from a novel that I started writing back in 2010 and have worked on on and off since then.  I think something that early apps were missing was a longer story with real, complex characters.  But it's tricky to add so much text into a game or interactive context.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the tools I've created while building the app is a squiggly drawing thing using JS and HTML5 Canvas.  It's a pretty simple drawing script that just animates the points of the drawing a little bit, in the style of Dr. Katz or early Home Movies episodes.  The drawing interface won't be part of the app, but a way for me to make and save drawings.  You can play with it <a href="http://owenroberts.github.io/lines/draw.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and if you like a drawing, press space bar and it will print out the point on the website, copy and paste it into an email and send it to me at obroberts at gmail.</p>
