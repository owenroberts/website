<p>Here's a collection of some of the projects I worked on during my time at the Intel store with Maker Education Initiative.</p>

<p>December 30, 2013:</p>
<p>I spent today working on that circuit using some parts from a clock radio Emmanuel brought in and built a little Intel puppet with the audio synth as a voice.</p>

<p>December 28, 2013:</p>
<p>today I used one of the motor circuits I worked on yesterday, and, using a motor from a printer, a volume control from a cd player and an old cell phone power supply, I made a circuit to change the speed of a motor, and then attached a cute Hello Kitty balloon toy made by Shelley.</p>

<p>December 27, 2013:</p>
<p>Today I found a printer in the recycling bin and took it apart to see what I could find. I found a bunch of little components, 4 DC motors and a stepper motor. I built a new circuit based on some of the 555 timer stuff I've been looking at on Make Zine but burned out one of my 555s. Oops! Hopefully tomorrow I can make something cool with all those motors.</p>
