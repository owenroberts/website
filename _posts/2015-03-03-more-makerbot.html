<p>I 3D printed an enclosure for an <a href="http://www.theeatingmachine.com/workshop/maker-workshop.html">audio synth</a> that I made for some workshops last year.  The first three to print the base failed for various reasons but overall it was relatively easy.  This was the precursor to designing an enclosure for my new digital interface design for the HWVY music stuff.</p>
