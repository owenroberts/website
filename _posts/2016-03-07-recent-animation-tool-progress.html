<p>Started working on my new app/fiction/animation project and added some features to the animation tool I started last semester:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2016-03-07-at-11-18-44-pm.png" /></p>
<p>Including new colors, a frame preview window, and functions to "explode" and "follow" a drawing.  This is all in HTML5 canvas, no rendered images.</p>
<p>Only problem I just realized is that this json file with the animation data is 19 mb.  Need to compress this little guy!</p>
