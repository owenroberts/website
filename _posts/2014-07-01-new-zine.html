<p>Made a new little zine based on the cellular automata algorithm used to generate the maze in maze3d.  It's a poem about trying to fall asleep.  You can see the digital version <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/work/poems/fall.html" target="blank">here</a>.  Eventually the grid will settle into a maze like series of lines but as long as the letters are flashing around you can read the whole poem.</p>
