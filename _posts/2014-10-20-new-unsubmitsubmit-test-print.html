<p>Tycho and I printed some of the designs Mimi and I cut out back in August/September and they looked much better than the tests we tried.  I'm getting excited about the project again, which has had many bumps since Mimi and I first started talking about it back in like February or March.  The ink is still drying, so I haven't bound the test book, but I'm excited to see what it will look like.</p>
